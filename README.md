# rateanalyzer
R Library to calculate solar savings from residential greenbutton data
The functions in this R library can be accessed from the endpoint https://research.energycenter.org/ocpu/library/rateanalyzer/R.

As written, these functions use SDG&E residential electric rates, but can be forked and modified for use with other utilities rates.
